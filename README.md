# marketing-analysis
This project is a marketing analysis of campaigns conducted by Portuguese banking institutions. Campaigns are conducted over the telephone. Often, multiple calls are made to a single client before they either reject or approve a term deposit subscription. 'y' represents a client's response in the form of either refusing or agreeing to a term deposit subscription.
